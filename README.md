# SugarTown 
## Introduction

**Welcome to SugarTown!**

This is a blog engine written in [NancyFX][1] that allows you to write blog posts and then exposes the contents via an API to allow you to incorporate a blog into an existing website. 

**Why SugarTown?**

NancyFX gets its name from the Ruby web framework [Sinatra][2] (Nancy was the daughter of Frank) so I thought I'd use this type of name formatting to select a name for this project.  I thought I would choose one of Nancy Sinatra's best known recordings* and out of the options, I chose the first (you might think I should have chosen the second) plus SugarTown sounds good for a piece of software!

Please check out the demo projects ![screenshot][3]
